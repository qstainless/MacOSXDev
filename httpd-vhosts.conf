# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.


# Makes your Sites directory as localhost
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot "/Users/[username]/Sites"
    ErrorLog "/Users/[username]/Sites/logs/_error_log"
    CustomLog "/Users/[username]/Sites/logs/_access_log" common
    ServerAdmin [your email]
    <Directory "/Users/[username]/Sites">
        Require all granted
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

# Replace [domain] for the domain name you wish to use
# Replace [ext] for the domain extension you wish to use
#
# i.e., mytestdomain.test, testing.dev, myawesomeapp.com
#
# The domain.ext MUST match the same in the hosts file
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName [domain].[ext]
    ServerAlias www.[domain].[ext]
    DocumentRoot "/Users/[username]/Sites/[domain]/public"
    ErrorLog "/Users/[username]/Sites/[domain]/logs/_error_log"
    CustomLog "/Users/[username]/Sites/[domain]/logs/_access_log" common
    ServerAdmin [your email]
    <Directory "/Users/[username]/Sites/[domain]">
        Require all granted
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
